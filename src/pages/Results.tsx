We managed to get everything stable just 10 minutes before the demo.",
      score: 85,
      feedback: "Good example with clear problem and resolution. Consider using the STAR method more explicitly: Situation, Task, Action, Result."

      question: "Why are you interested in this position?",
      answer: "I'm attracted to this role because it aligns with my passion for building user-focused products.

The tech stack you use also matches my experience perfectly.",

    },
    {
      question: "Where do you see yourself in five years?",
      answer: "In five years, I hope to have grown into a senior or lead engineer role where I can mentor others while still maintaining hands-on development work. I'm also interested in deepening my expertise in distributed systems and cloud architecture.",
      score: 82,
      feedback: "Good balance between ambition and realism. Consider connecting your goals more explicitly to how they would benefit the company."
